# Data Exploration
I created several questions to explore the dataset after cleaning it so we can gain insights from it. 

## Customer Demographics:

1. What are the primary age groups, genders, and locations of our customers?
2. What is the average income level of our customer base?
3. Are certain demographic segments more likely to make high-value purchases?

## Purchase Behavior:

1. Which products are the most popular among our customers?
2. Are there specific product categories that consistently perform well or underperform?
3. What is the average value of customer orders?

## Customer Loyalty and Retention:

1. What is our current customer retention rate?
2. Which strategies are most effective in retaining customers?
3. Are there noticeable trends in repeat purchases or customer churn?

## Promotional Effectiveness:

1. Which marketing channels or campaigns generate the most sales?
2. What types of promotions or discounts are most effective in driving customer engagement?
3. How do different promotions influence customer behavior?
